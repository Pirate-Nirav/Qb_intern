'''sequence[Start : End : Step]

Parameters:

Start: It is the starting point of the slice or substring.
End: It is the ending point of the slice or substring but it does not include the last index.
Step: It is number of steps it takes.
Pythonâ€™s slice() function provides an alternative definition of slicing parameters as reusable slice objects.
These objects encapsulate slicing logic and can be applied across multiple sequences.
